{"name":"MemdumpDroid (6.0)","tagline":"The Experimental ROM","body":"### Idea.\r\nThe core idea behind this project is to create a custom ROM based on _Android 6.0_ in which various experimental stuff would be implemented either just as a proof of concept or as a full blown solution with all the necessities. At the moment the project orientation is towards subjects such as security, optimization and functionality. However this doesn't mean that this can't change in the future.\r\n\r\n### What MemdumpDroid is and what it isn't\r\nMemdumpDroid is an experiment to try out new exciting ideas. MemdumpDroid doesn't try (and probably never will) to be a cool looking fancy mainstream ROM.   \r\nAt the very moment only Google Nexus 5 devices are supported \r\n\r\n### Project plans & todo\r\n1. Add call blocking (GSM/Voip) functionality (will elaborate more on this in near future)\r\n2. Implement fake location reporting functionality\r\n3. IMSI-Catcher detection\r\n(will update in future)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n1.
